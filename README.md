# AUhansard_said

A collection of scripts used in producing the `AUhansard_said` Twitter feed, which posts a notification every time a new word is used in Hansard debates in the Australian parliament. Data comes from data.openaustralia.org.au which goes back to 2006 so "new" means "unused since 2006".

This is a WIP and some manual processes are still involved in posting notifications, improvements are underway.
